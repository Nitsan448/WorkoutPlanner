Add choice between set time and repetitions


After learning node.js:

add workouts
edit workouts
delete workouts
add Exercises
edit exercises
delete exercises (delete routine, and delete exercise if it there are no more routines with this exercise id)

when adding workout - go to edit page for that workout, if the user did not add a unique name and at least one exercise. Delete the workout when he leaves (after telling him it will happen)
